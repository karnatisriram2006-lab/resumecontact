    "reasoning": "The Firestore data structure is designed to securely store resume requests and contact messages while providing an efficient admin dashboard. Key to this structure is Authorization Independence, achieved through path-based ownership for private data. This eliminates the need for `get()` calls in security rules, allowing for atomic operations and easier debugging.\n\n*   `/resumeRequests/{resumeRequestId}`: This collection stores resume requests. No user ownership is explicitly modeled since these requests are intended to be managed by the admin, therefore securing the collection is done via role-based checks on the backend.\n*   `/contactMessages/{contactMessageId}`: This collection stores contact messages. Similar to resume requests, access is managed by backend role-based checks.\n\nThis structure facilitates simple, robust, and debuggable security rules by:\n\n*   Segregating data with different access requirements into separate collections (resumeRequests vs. contactMessages).\n*   Avoiding hierarchical authorization dependencies.\n\nThe structure also supports required QAPs:\n\n*   Secure `list` operations: Because collections are segregated, rules can be written to allow listing entire collections based on admin roles."
